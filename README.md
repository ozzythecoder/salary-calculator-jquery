# Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: Weekend project

This program accepts an employee's name, ID number, title, and annual salary, and stores these data points in a table. You can add or remove employees as needed to narrow your results. The total monthly cost of all employees' salaries will be shown at the bottom, rounded up to the nearest dollar. If the monthly costs exceed $20,000, the total will show a red background as a warning. If the program encounters any errors, those errors will be displayed immediately below the submit button.

### Notes

- All fields are required; you can't add an employee without a last name, for example.
